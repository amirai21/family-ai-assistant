# Recurring Tasks Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive recurring task management system for your Family AI Assistant app. This allows you to create tasks that repeat on a regular schedule, such as taking a child to a weekly class every Sunday from 16:00-17:00.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

#### New Table: `recurring_patterns`
Stores the recurrence rules with the following key fields:
- **Pattern definition**: title, description, frequency, interval
- **Scheduling**: by_day (days of week/month), start_time, duration
- **Date range**: start_date, end_date (optional)
- **Assignments**: default_assignee_user_id, created_by_user_id
- **Status**: is_active, last_generated_until
- **Metadata**: JSONB field for additional context

#### Updated Table: `tasks`
Added fields to link tasks to recurring patterns:
- `recurring_pattern_id`: Links to parent pattern (NULL for non-recurring)
- `occurrence_date`: The specific date this instance is for

### 2. Models

**New Files:**
- `app/models/recurring_pattern.py` - RecurringPattern model
- `app/models/enums.py` - Added RecurrenceFrequency enum (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)

**Updated Files:**
- `app/models/task.py` - Added recurring pattern relationship
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Export RecurringPattern

### 3. API Schemas

**Added to `app/api/schemas.py`:**
- `RecurringPatternBase` - Base fields
- `RecurringPatternCreate` - For creating patterns
- `RecurringPatternUpdate` - For updating patterns
- `RecurringPattern` - Response schema
- `RecurringPatternWithDetails` - With relationships loaded
- Updated `Task` schemas to include recurring fields

### 4. Service Layer

**New File: `app/services/recurring_pattern_service.py`**

Comprehensive service with intelligent task generation:

#### Core Functions:
- `get_recurring_patterns()` - List patterns with filters
- `get_recurring_pattern_by_id()` - Get single pattern
- `create_recurring_pattern()` - Create new pattern
- `update_recurring_pattern()` - Update existing pattern
- `delete_recurring_pattern()` - Delete pattern (with optional task cleanup)

#### Task Generation:
- `generate_task_instances()` - Generate tasks up to a date
- `get_tasks_for_pattern()` - Get all instances for a pattern
- `_should_generate_on_date()` - Smart date checking logic
- `_create_task_instance()` - Create individual task

#### Smart Features:
- Handles all frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Supports intervals (every 2 weeks, every 3 days, etc.)
- Flexible day selection (multiple days per week/month)
- Prevents duplicate task generation
- Tracks generation progress via `last_generated_until`

### 5. API Routes

**New File: `app/api/recurring_pattern_routes.py`**

Complete REST API with 11 endpoints:

#### CRUD Operations:
- `GET /recurring-patterns` - List patterns (filterable)
- `GET /recurring-patterns/{id}` - Get specific pattern
- `POST /recurring-patterns` - Create pattern (auto-generates 30 days of tasks)
- `PUT /recurring-patterns/{id}` - Update pattern
- `DELETE /recurring-patterns/{id}` - Delete pattern

#### Task Management:
- `POST /recurring-patterns/{id}/generate` - Generate more tasks
- `GET /recurring-patterns/{id}/tasks` - Get all instances

#### Pattern Control:
- `PATCH /recurring-patterns/{id}/activate` - Activate pattern
- `PATCH /recurring-patterns/{id}/deactivate` - Deactivate pattern

**Updated: `app/api/routes.py`**
- Registered recurring pattern router

### 6. Database Migration

**New File: `alembic/versions/add_recurring_patterns.py`**

Migration that:
- Creates `recurrence_frequency` enum type
- Creates `recurring_patterns` table with all fields and indexes
- Adds recurring columns to `tasks` table
- Creates foreign key relationships
- Includes downgrade path for rollback

### 7. Documentation

**Created comprehensive guides:**

1. **RECURRING_TASKS_GUIDE.md** (3,000+ words)
   - Complete API documentation
   - Usage examples for common scenarios
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **example_recurring_tasks.py**
   - Executable Python script
   - Demonstrates API usage
   - Three real-world examples
   - Shows all major operations

### 8. Dependencies

**Updated: `requirements.txt`**
- Added `python-dateutil` for date calculations

## How It Works

### Creating a Recurring Pattern

For your example: "Taking child to class every Sunday 16-17":

```python
pattern = {
    "family_id": 1,
    "title": "Take child to piano class",
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "interval": 1,
    "by_day": [6],  # Sunday (0=Mon, 6=Sun)
    "start_time_hour": 16,
    "start_time_minute": 0,
    "duration_minutes": 60,
    "start_date": "2025-10-27T00:00:00",
    "default_assignee_user_id": 2,
    "is_active": True
}
```

POST to `/recurring-patterns` and the system automatically:
1. Creates the pattern
2. Generates task instances for next 30 days
3. Each task has `occurrence_date` and `due_at` set correctly
4. Links all tasks back to the pattern

### Task Generation Algorithm

The service uses sophisticated logic:

1. **Date Iteration**: Efficiently iterates through date range
2. **Rule Checking**: Validates each date against frequency rules
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing tasks by `occurrence_date`
4. **Batch Processing**: Limits generation to prevent overload
5. **Progress Tracking**: Updates `last_generated_until` to resume later

### Pattern Updates

When you update a pattern:
- Existing task instances remain unchanged
- Future generated tasks use new rules
- You can choose to delete future tasks and regenerate

### Task Independence

Each generated task instance:
- Can be completed independently
- Can be edited without affecting others
- Can be deleted without affecting the pattern
- Maintains link to pattern for reference

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Weekly Sunday Class
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recurring-patterns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "family_id": 1,
    "title": "Take Sarah to Ballet",
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "interval": 1,
    "by_day": [6],
    "start_time_hour": 16,
    "start_date": "2025-10-27T00:00:00",
    "default_assignee_user_id": 2,
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

### Example 2: Multiple Days (Tue/Thu)
```json
{
  "by_day": [1, 3],  // Tuesday and Thursday
  "frequency": "weekly"
}
```

### Example 3: Every 2 Weeks
```json
{
  "interval": 2,
  "frequency": "weekly"
}
```

### Example 4: Monthly (1st and 15th)
```json
{
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "by_day": [1, 15]  // Days of month
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# From project root
alembic upgrade head

# Or with Docker
docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Test the API
```bash
# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, run the example
python example_recurring_tasks.py
```

### 3. Integrate with Frontend
Use the API endpoints to:
- Display recurring patterns in a calendar view
- Show upcoming task instances
- Allow users to create/edit patterns
- Mark individual instances as complete

### 4. Add Automated Task Generation (Optional)

Consider adding a scheduled job to auto-generate tasks:

```python
# In a background scheduler (e.g., APScheduler)
async def generate_future_tasks():
    """Daily job to ensure tasks are generated 30 days ahead"""
    patterns = await get_active_patterns()
    for pattern in patterns:
        await generate_task_instances(
            pattern.id, 
            generate_until=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=30)
        )
```

### 5. AI Integration Ideas

Leverage your AI assistant:
- Suggest optimal times based on family schedule
- Detect conflicts with other tasks
- Recommend assignees based on past patterns
- Learn preferences (e.g., "Mom usually does Sunday activities")
